    <h1>Tofu Banh Mi</h1>
    <img src="../images/banh_mi.jpg" alt="Tofu Banh Mi Sandwhich">

    <h4>A Banh Mi is a popular Vietnamese sandwhich usually made up of 
        a baguette filled with meat (or tofu), pickled vegetables, and 
        peppers. It is usually made with some type of aoli spread and 
        topped with cilantro as shown above.</h4>

        <p>
            The story of the banh mi sandwhich begins back in the 17th 
            century when France colonized Vietnam. As part of their colonization 
            the French introduced their own foods such as baguettes, cold cuts,
            butter, and cheese. However, it was not until after the decicive 
            defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu that the Vietnamese were free 
            to adapt these foods. Mayonnaise was used as a substitute for butter 
            and veggies took the place of pricier cold cuts.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mr. and Mrs. Le were the first to create the banh mi by putting
            the ingredients into the baguette so that customers could easily carry
            and eat their meal. The banh mi has since grown immensely popular and is 
            a relatively cheap, flavorfol meal. In 1975 after Saigon fell, many Vietnamese 
            citizens fled and took the recipe for this simple sandwhich with them to other 
            places around the globe.
