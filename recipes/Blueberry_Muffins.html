    <h4>Freshly Baked Blueberry Muffins</h4>

        <p>
            Blueberry muffins date back to the 18th century. When English colonists 
            discovered blueberries, which are native only to North America, they added them to baked goods and carried both 
            the recipe and blueberries back to England. 
        </p>

        <p>
           Originally, European bakers used a berry known as "bilberry" for baking muffins,
            scones, pies, etc. but were unable to find it in America which led to them adopting 
            the native blueberries.
